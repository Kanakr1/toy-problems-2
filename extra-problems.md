Extra Problems
==============

If you get bored, here are some extra problems you might tackle:

* Given a function which produces a random integer in the range 1 to 5, write a
  function which produces a random integer in the range 1 to 7.

* Write a regular expression which matches a email address.

* Write a function `f(a, b)` which takes two strings as arguments and returns a
  string containing only the characters found in both strings, in the order that
  they appeared in `a`. Write a version which is order N-squared and one which is
  order N.

* Tree search algorithms. Write Breadth-First- and Depth-First-Search code, and
  explain run time and space requirements. Modify the code to handle trees with
  loops.  Make the code print out path to goal state.

* Implement division (without using the divide operator, obviously).

* Write a function that, given a binary tree, checks if it is a binary search tree.

* Update your stack from the previous exercise so that it can retrieve the minimum
  element in constant time.

* Given two binary trees, write a compare function to check if they are equal or
  not. Being equal means that they have the same value and same structure.

* How do you find out the fifth maximum element in an Binary Search Tree in an
  efficient manner?

* If a person dials a sequence of numbers on the telephone, what possible
  words/strings can be formed from the letters associated with those numbers?
