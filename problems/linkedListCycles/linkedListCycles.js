/*
 * Assignmnet: Write a function that can detect whether or not a linked list has a cycle
 *
 * Explanation: A 'cycle' in a linked list is when traversing the list would result in visiting the same nodes over and over
 * This is caused by pointing a node in the list to another node that already appeared earlier in the list. Example:
 * node1.next points to node2
 * node2.next points to node3
 * node3.next points to node2
 *
 * You should write an algorithm that can return true or false, depending on whether the input list has a cycle
 *
 * Constraint 1:
 * Do this in linear time
 *
 * Constraint 2:
 * Do this in constant space
 *
 * Constraint 3:
 * Do not mutate the original nodes in any way
